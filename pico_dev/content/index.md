# About
## All About Jack Szwergold

***

Experienced systems architect, developer and overall computer/tech professional
with skills that have been honed in the world of art, design, education,
publishing and the humanities.


### Great Full-Stack Web Developer
I am a full-stack web developer who knows all sides of the tech
equation—front-end, back-end, server-side, etc…—who can develop code from
scratch as well as develop within CMS systems such as WordPress, Drupal and the
like. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby and related languages—as well as
frameworks—are all fine with me.

### Skilled Back-End Tech
I am a real-world proven overall systems tech. DevOps-skilled, macOS/Linux
systems experienced, adept at command line and related back-end skills. Shell
scripting, Python, Apache, Nginx, Docker, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, Java,
Elasticsearch, Solr, Nutch, Hadoop and the like are the tools I know I how to
use.

### Experienced Web Server Consultant
I have deep and proven skills dealing the infrastructural “plumbing” of web
servers and related systems. Domain names, DNS setup, site hosting and
miscellaneous website hosting items are just some of the things I can deal with.
DIY services like Squarespace, Wix and related shared hosting services are no
problem for me.
