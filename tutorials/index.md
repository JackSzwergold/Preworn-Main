This is where I will be compiling things I have learned over my 20+ years of being a web developer, Unix user, systems administrator & more generally, “That guy who does things by typing into a green terminal window.”

I’m mainly compiling these things for my reference, but if you stuble across this & find it useful… Hey! All cool.
