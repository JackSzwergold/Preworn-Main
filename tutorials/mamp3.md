# Setting up MAMP 2.1.4

## Part 3: Installing the PHP Pear Library for MAMP

Now we'll install the whole PHP Pear library under MAMP. Yes, the whole library. Why? Easy. Because when I use MAMP for a test environment, I often deal with developers or  projects that make use of PEAR. And I donâ€™t have the time to really install individual Pear items via the command line each time I launch MAMP. Much better to just install them all & just develop.
