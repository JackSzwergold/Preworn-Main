Experienced systems architect, developer and overall computer/tech professional with skills that have been honed in the world of art, design, education, publishing and the humanities.


### Great Full-Stack Web Developer
I am a full-stack web developer who knows all sides of the tech
equation—front-end, back-end, server-side, etc…—who can develop code from scratch as well as develop within CMS systems such as WordPress, Drupal and the like. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby and related languages—as well as frameworks—are all fine with me.

### Skilled Back-End Tech
I am a real-world proven overall systems tech. DevOps-skilled, macOS/Linux systems experienced, adept at command line and related back-end skills. Shell scripting, Python, Apache, Nginx, Docker, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, Java, Elasticsearch, Solr, Nutch, Hadoop and the like are the tools I know I how to
use.

### Experienced Web Server Consultant
I have deep and proven skills dealing the infrastructural “plumbing” of web servers and related systems. Domain names, DNS setup, site hosting and miscellaneous website hosting items are just some of the things I can deal with. DIY services like Squarespace, Wix and related shared hosting services are no
problem for me.
