## DevOps-Ready Skilled Tech, Developer, Administrator and Security Analyst

This is Jack Szwergold’s technical portfolio and calling card.

* If you are interested check out my development skills—via actual code samples—please head over to ***[my GitHub repository][github]***.
* I’ve also compiled a ***[collection of tutorials and cheat sheets][tutorials]*** over the years; mainly for my own personal reference but for others as well.

## Projects

Here are some simple projects I’ve done to stretch my skills and show off my front-end design and engineering skills:

* **[Mosaic][mosaic]:** Dynamically generated image mosaics using record album artwork as the basis. Reload the page to view another random image.
* **[Mosaic (JavaScript)][mosaic_js]**: This is an EmberJS (JavaScript) version of the [Mosaic][mosaic] project that uses an EmberJS front-end to pull data in from the PHP backend of [Mosaic][mosaic]. The benefit of this method is the page does not have to be reloaded for new data to be pulled in; client side JavaScript handles it all.
* **[ASCII][ascii]:** Dynamically generated ASCII art images which were created using PHP, the GD graphics library, HTML and CSS. Reload the page to view another random image.
* **[Slider][slider]:** This simple slider—which works well on desktop as well as mobile browsers—is something I created using jQuery and CSS3 WebKit extensions.
* **[Floating Cube (JavaScript)][floatingcube_js]:** The core HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding for a floating cube concept developed for an Apache Cordova app.
* **[Nine Dots (JavaScript)][ninedots_js]:** The core HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding for a nine dots concept developed for an Apache Cordova app.
* **[Lexicon][lexicon]:** A simple program that picks and displays random words and pseudo-words I find interesting.
* **[Lexicon (JavaScript)][lexicon_js]:** This is an EmberJS (JavaScript) version of the [Lexicon][lexicon] project that uses an EmberJS front-end to pull data in from the PHP backend of [Lexicon][lexicon]. The benefit of this method is the page does not have to be reloaded for new data to be pulled in; client side JavaScript handles it all.
* **[Instagram][instagram]:** Some experiments and explorations into the basic, “sandbox”-level of Instagram API access. 
* **[Holiday Card 2016][holiday_card_2016]:** My 2016 digital holiday card that uses WebKit animations. 

## Skills

Skilled full-stack developer, systems admin and engineer with years of experience which includes experience in the art, publishing and non-profit worlds.

I use both sides of my brain: Front-end and back-end development are no problem for me!

Excellent set of skills for DevOps as well as Level 2/3 support and related software development. Very comfortable working in the terminal console on Mac OS X, Ubuntu, Debian, RedHat, CentOS and Solaris environments. Can install/configure software packages from core repositories as well as compile binaries from source on most any platform. Adept at Unix/Linux shell scripting and other sundry programming languages, protocols and frameworks such as:

* **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **XHTML**, **JSON**,  **XML**, **YAML**
* **JavaScript** (jQuery, AngularJS, NodeJS, EmberJS, Scriptaculous and Prototype)
* **PHP** (Flat and OOP, Zend, Codeigniter, Symfony and Laravel)
* **Ruby** (Flat and OOP, Ruby on Rails)
* **Apache Cordova** (Flat and Ionic Framework)
* **MySQL**, **MariaDB**, **MongoDB** and other relational and non-relational database systems.
* **Java**, **Elasticsearch**, **Solr**, **Nutch**, **Hadoop**, etc…

I work primarily on the Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS X platforms but have deep experience with many different flavors of Unix/Linux spanning back to the early 1990s. So I can jump onto the terminal console and maneuvering around to get the job done regardless of OS.
