# Preworn

This site is Jack Szwergold’s the technical calling card and portfolio. If you are interested in my creative work—writing, computer art, visual art and such—please check out *[Last Place Champ][1]*. To check out my coding skills—via actual code samples—please head over to [my GitHub repository][12].

### [Tutorials and Cheat Sheets][2]

Here is a [collection of tutorials and cheat sheets][2] I’ve compiled for my own personal reference—and to share with clients as well as other techs—over the years.


### Projects

I’ve created some simple projects to stretch/show off my frontend deisgn/engineering skills such as these [dynamically generated image mosaics][3] using record album artwork as the basis ([here is a functional test of the the EmberJS JavaScript front end][4]) and these [dynamically generated ASCII art images][5] which were created using PHP, the GD graphics library, HTML and CSS. This [simple slider][6]—which works well on desktop as well as mobile browsers—is something I created using jQuery and CSS3 WebKit extensions.

### Skills

I’m a highly skilled Unix systems administrator, web developer and systems engineer with 20+ years of experience which includes a strong professional history in the fine art world.

Excellent set of skills for DevOps as well as Level 2/3 support and related consulting. Unix systems administration, shell scripting and other common web/Unix/Internet scripting languages as well as software development using HTML5, CSS3, XHTML, XML, JavaScript (jQuery, AngularJS, NodeNS, EmberJS, Scriptaculous and Prototype), PHP (Flat & OOP, Zend, Codeigniter, Symfony, Laravel), Apache Cordova (Ionic), Ruby (Flat & OOP, Ruby on Rails), Java, MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Unix/Linux shell scripting and other common server scripting languages. Very comfortable working in the Unix shell in Ubuntu, RedHat, CentOS and Solaris environments. Can install/configure packages from repositories and compile from source code on most any platform.

I work primarily on the Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS X platforms but have deep experience with many different flavors of Unix spanning back to the early 1990s. So I can jump onto the console, maneuver around the terminal and get the job done regardless of OS.
