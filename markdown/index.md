## Great Full-Stack Web Developer

I am a full-stack web developer who knows all sides of the tech equation—front-end, back-end, server-side, etc…—who can develop code from scratch as well as develop within CMS systems such as WordPress, Drupal and the like. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby and related languages plus frameworks are all fine with me.

## Skilled Back-End Tech

I am a real-world proven overall systems tech. DevOps-skilled, macOS/Linux systems experienced, adept at command line and related back-end skills. Shell scripting, Python, Apache, Nginx, Docker, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, Java, Elasticsearch, Solr, Nutch, Hadoop and the like are the tools I know I how to use.

## Experienced Web Server Consultant

I have deep and proven skills dealing the infrastructural “plumbing” of  web servers and related systems. Domain names, DNS setup, site hosting and miscellaneous website hosting items are just some of the things I can deal with. DIY services like Squarespace, Wix and related shared hosting services are no problem for me.

## Projects

Here are some simple projects I’ve done to stretch my skills and show off my front-end development and design skills:

* **[Mosaic][mosaic]:** Dynamically generated image mosaics using record album artwork as the basis. Reload the page to view another random image.
* **[Mosaic (JavaScript)][mosaic_js]**: This is an EmberJS (JavaScript) version of the [Mosaic][mosaic] project that uses an EmberJS front-end to pull data in from the PHP back-end of [Mosaic][mosaic]. The benefit of this method is the page does not have to be reloaded for new data to be pulled in; client side JavaScript handles it all.
* **[ASCII][ascii]:** Dynamically generated ASCII art images which were created using PHP, the GD graphics library, HTML and CSS. Reload the page to view another random image.
* **[Slider][slider]:** This simple slider—which works well on desktop as well as mobile browsers—is something I created using jQuery and CSS3 WebKit extensions.
* **[Floating Cube (JavaScript)][floatingcube_js]:** The core HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding for a floating cube concept developed for an Apache Cordova app.
* **[Nine Dots (JavaScript)][ninedots_js]:** The core HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding for a nine dots concept developed for an Apache Cordova app.
* **[Lexicon][lexicon]:** A simple program that picks and displays random words and pseudo-words I find interesting.
* **[Lexicon (JavaScript)][lexicon_js]:** This is an EmberJS (JavaScript) version of the [Lexicon][lexicon] project that uses an EmberJS front-end to pull data in from the PHP back-end of [Lexicon][lexicon]. The benefit of this method is the page does not have to be reloaded for new data to be pulled in; client side JavaScript handles it all.
* **[Instagram][instagram]:** Some experiments and explorations into the basic, “sandbox”-level of Instagram API access. 
* **[Holiday Card 2016][holiday_card_2016]:** My 2016 digital holiday card that uses WebKit animations.
