excellent set of skills for devops. unix systems administration, shell scripting & other common web/unix/internet scripting languages as well as software development using php (object oriented & flat), javascript, mysql, css, json, html, dhtml, xhtml & xml. very comfortable working in the unix shell in ubuntu, redhat, centos & solaris environments. can install/configure packages from repositories & compile from source code on most any platform.

i work primarily on the ubuntu & mac os x platforms but have deep experience with many different flavors of unix spanning back to the early 1990s. so i can jump onto the console, maneuver around the terminal and get the job done regardless of os.
