# Preworn

## Skilled Tech, Developer, Administrator and Security Analyst

This is Jack Szwergold’s technical portfolio and calling card.

* If you are interested check out my development skills—via actual code samples—please head over to [my GitHub repository][12].
* I’ve also compiled a [collection of tutorials and cheat sheets][2] over the years; mainly for my own personal reference but for others as well.

If you are interested in my non-technical creative work—writing, visual art and such—please check out my other website, *[Last Place Champ][1]*. 

## Projects

I’ve created some simple projects to stretch my skills and show off my front-end design/engineering skills such as these [dynamically generated image mosaics][3] using record album artwork as the basis ([here is a functional test of the the EmberJS JavaScript front end][4]) and these [dynamically generated ASCII art images][5] which were created using PHP, the GD graphics library, HTML and CSS. This [simple slider][6]—which works well on desktop as well as mobile browsers—is something I created using jQuery and CSS3 WebKit extensions.

## Skills

I’m a highly skilled software developer, Unix systems administrator and overall systems engineer with 20+ years of experience which includes a strong professional history in the art, publishing and non-profit world.

Excellent set of skills for DevOps as well as Level 2/3 support and related software development. Very comfortable working in the terminal console on Mac OS X, Ubuntu, Debian, RedHat, CentOS and Solaris environments. Can install/configure software packages from core repositories as well as compile binaries from source on most any platform. Adept at Unix/Linux shell scripting and other sundry programming languages, protocols and frameworks such as:

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **JSON**
* **XHTML**
* **XML**
* **JavaScript** (jQuery, AngularJS, NodeJS, EmberJS, Scriptaculous and Prototype)
* **PHP** (Flat and OOP, Zend, Codeigniter, Symfony, Laravel)
* **Ruby** (Flat and OOP, Ruby on Rails)
* **Apache Cordova** (Flat and Ionic Framework)
* **Java**
* **MySQL**
* **MongoDB**
* **Elasticsearch**
* **Solr**
* **Nutch**
* **Hadoop**

I work primarily on the Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS X platforms but have deep experience with many different flavors of Unix/Linux spanning back to the early 1990s. So I can jump onto the terminal console and maneuvering around to get the job done regardless of OS.
