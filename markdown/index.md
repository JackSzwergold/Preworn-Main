## Full-Stack Web Developer with DevOps-Ready SysAdmin and Security Consultant Skills

Welcome to Jack Szwergold’s technical portfolio and calling card. Here is my ***[collection of tutorials and cheat sheets][tutorials]*** and check out my ***[my GitHub repository][github]***

### Excellent Web Developer

I am a full-stack web developer who can develop code from scratch as well as develop within CMS systems such as WordPress, Drupal and the like. Front-end, back-end, all sides of the web stack are good with me. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby and related languages are fine with me.

### Skilled Backend Tech

I am a real-world proven overall systems tech. DevOps-skilled, Linux systems experienced, adept at command line and related backend skills. Shell scripting, Python, Apache, Nginx, Docker, and the like are the tools I know I how to use.

### Great Web Hosting Consultant

I have deep and proven skills dealing the infrastructural “plumbing” of  web servers and related systems. Domain names, DNS setup, site hosting and miscellaneous website hosting items are just some of the things I can deal with. DIY services like Squarespace, Wix and related shared hosting services are no problem for me.

## Projects

Here are some simple projects I’ve done to stretch my skills and show off my front-end design and engineering skills:

* **[Mosaic][mosaic]:** Dynamically generated image mosaics using record album artwork as the basis. Reload the page to view another random image.
* **[Mosaic (JavaScript)][mosaic_js]**: This is an EmberJS (JavaScript) version of the [Mosaic][mosaic] project that uses an EmberJS front-end to pull data in from the PHP backend of [Mosaic][mosaic]. The benefit of this method is the page does not have to be reloaded for new data to be pulled in; client side JavaScript handles it all.
* **[ASCII][ascii]:** Dynamically generated ASCII art images which were created using PHP, the GD graphics library, HTML and CSS. Reload the page to view another random image.
* **[Slider][slider]:** This simple slider—which works well on desktop as well as mobile browsers—is something I created using jQuery and CSS3 WebKit extensions.
* **[Floating Cube (JavaScript)][floatingcube_js]:** The core HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding for a floating cube concept developed for an Apache Cordova app.
* **[Nine Dots (JavaScript)][ninedots_js]:** The core HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding for a nine dots concept developed for an Apache Cordova app.
* **[Lexicon][lexicon]:** A simple program that picks and displays random words and pseudo-words I find interesting.
* **[Lexicon (JavaScript)][lexicon_js]:** This is an EmberJS (JavaScript) version of the [Lexicon][lexicon] project that uses an EmberJS front-end to pull data in from the PHP backend of [Lexicon][lexicon]. The benefit of this method is the page does not have to be reloaded for new data to be pulled in; client side JavaScript handles it all.
* **[Instagram][instagram]:** Some experiments and explorations into the basic, “sandbox”-level of Instagram API access. 
* **[Holiday Card 2016][holiday_card_2016]:** My 2016 digital holiday card that uses WebKit animations. 

## Skills

I am a skilled full-stack web developer, systems admin and software engineer with years of experience which includes career experience within the art, publishing and non-profit worlds.

My skillset is an excellent match for web development, DevOps, level 2/3 support and related software development. Very comfortable working in the terminal console on Mac OS X, Ubuntu, Debian, RedHat, CentOS and Solaris environments:

* **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **XHTML**, **JSON**,  **XML**, **YAML**
* **JavaScript** (jQuery, AngularJS, NodeJS, EmberJS, Scriptaculous and Prototype)
* **PHP** (Flat and OOP, Zend, Codeigniter, Symfony and Laravel)
* **Ruby** (Flat and OOP, Ruby on Rails)
* **Apache Cordova** (Flat and Ionic Framework)
* **MySQL**, **MariaDB**, **MongoDB** and other relational and non-relational database systems.
* **Java**, **Elasticsearch**, **Solr**, **Nutch**, **Hadoop**, etc…

I work primarily on macOS and sundry Linux platforms (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc…) but have deep experience with many different flavors of Unix/Linux spanning back to the early 1990s. I easilly can jump onto the terminal console and maneuvering around to get the job done regardless of OS.
