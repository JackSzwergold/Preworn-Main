This site is Jack Szwergold’s the calling card, gallery, portfolio, playground, white wall, black box, idea sandbox & daily distraction.

### Current Projects

[**Image Mosaic**][1] • A dynamically generated image mosaic using PHP, the GD graphics library, HTML & CSS.

[**Image ASCII**][2] • A dynamically generated ASCII art image using PHP, the GD graphics library, HTML & CSS.

[**Tutorials**][3] • This is where I will be compiling things I have learned over my 20+ years of being a tech person & problem solver.

### Skills

Excellent set of skills for DevOps as well as Level 2/3 support & related consulting. Unix systems administration, shell scripting & other common web/Unix/Internet scripting languages as well as software development using PHP (object oriented & flat), JavaScript, MySQL, CSS, JSON, HTML, dHTML, XHTML & XML. Very comfortable working in the Unix shell in Ubuntu, RedHat, CentOS & Solaris environments. Can install/configure packages from repositories & compile from source code on most any platform.

I work primarily on the Ubuntu & Mac OS X platforms but have deep experience with many different flavors of Unix spanning back to the early 1990s. So I can jump onto the console, maneuver around the terminal and get the job done regardless of OS.
