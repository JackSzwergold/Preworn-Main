This site is Jack Szwergold’s the technical calling card and portfolio. If you are interested in my creative work—writing, computer art, visual art and such—please check out *[Last Place Champ][1]*.

### [Tutorials and Cheat Sheets 📚][2]

Here is a [collection of tutorials and cheat sheets][2] I’ve compiled for my own personal reference—and to share with clients as well as other techs—over the years.

### Skills 🎓

Excellent set of skills for DevOps as well as Level 2/3 support and related consulting. Unix systems administration, shell scripting and other common web/Unix/Internet scripting languages as well as software development using PHP (object oriented and flat), Ruby (on Rails and off), MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, JavaScript, JSON, CSS, HTML, dHTML, XHTML and XML. Very comfortable working in the Unix shell in Ubuntu, RedHat, CentOS and Solaris environments. Can install/configure packages from repositories and compile from source code on most any platform.

I work primarily on the Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS X platforms but have deep experience with many different flavors of Unix spanning back to the early 1990s. So I can jump onto the console, maneuver around the terminal and get the job done regardless of OS.

### Support 💰

If you like any of the work I have done, will do, or am doing—or you just owe me money—please consider [tossing me a donation of some kind via PayPal][3]. Or if you can’t donate money—but you plan on buying stuff on Amazon—just [click this Amazon affiliate link][4] so I can get something out of that transaction.
