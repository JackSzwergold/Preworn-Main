# Preworn

This site is Jack Szwergold’s the technical calling card and portfolio. If you are interested in my creative work—writing, computer art, visual art and such—please check out [Last Place Champ][1].

### [Tutorials][2]

Here is a [collection of tutorials][1] based on things I have learned over the years.

### [Cheat Sheets][3]

Here is a [collection of my technical cheat sheets][2] I’ve compiled over the years.

### Skills

Excellent set of skills for DevOps as well as Level 2/3 support & related consulting. Unix systems administration, shell scripting & other common web/Unix/Internet scripting languages as well as software development using PHP (object oriented & flat), Ruby (on Rails and off), MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, JavaScript, JSON, CSS, HTML, dHTML, XHTML & XML. Very comfortable working in the Unix shell in Ubuntu, RedHat, CentOS & Solaris environments. Can install/configure packages from repositories & compile from source code on most any platform.

I work primarily on the Ubuntu & Mac OS X platforms but have deep experience with many different flavors of Unix spanning back to the early 1990s. So I can jump onto the console, maneuver around the terminal and get the job done regardless of OS.

### Support

If you like any of the work I have done, will do, or am doing—or you just owe me money—please consider [tossing me a donation of some kind via PayPal][4]. Or if you can’t donate money—but you plan on buying stuff on Amazon—just [click this Amazon affiliate link][5] so I can get something out of that transaction.
