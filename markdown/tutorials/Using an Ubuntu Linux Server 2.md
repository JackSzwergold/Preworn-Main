## Part 2: Setting Up a LAMP Stack

So in part 1 of my tutorial, I explained how I like to configure a base level Ubuntu server. In part 2 of my tutorial I will explain how to setup useful and solid LAMP stack that can be used as a production server or a development/sandbox server for web development needs.

### <a name="apache_and_php"></a> Install ‘apache’ and some basic ‘php’ stuff.

First, let’s install the core of the `apache` and `php` related stuff.

    sudo aptitude install apache2 apache2-threaded-dev php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php-pear

This is a fairly simple set of items that will be installed. `apache2` and `apache2-threaded-dev` are required for basic `apache` functionality. While `php5` and `libapache2-mod-php5` are required for basic `php` functionality on your system. The `php-pear` install is to allow you to do package installs from the `php` extension and application repository, aka: `pear`.

### <a name="php_modules"></a> Install the ‘php’ modules.

Now let’s install a basic set of `php` modules.

    sudo aptitude install php5-mysql php5-pgsql php5-odbc php5-sybase php5-sqlite php5-xmlrpc php5-json php5-xsl php5-curl php5-geoip php-getid3 php5-imap php5-ldap php5-mcrypt php5-pspell php5-gmp php5-gd

I am not going to do a deep breakdown of each module, but from my experience this is the most basic, complete and useful set of `php` modules most any web developer will be using.

### <a name="harden_php"></a> Harden the ‘php’ install.

With that done, let’s “harden” the `php` install by disabling `expose_php`. You want to do harden the install to prevent exposing your server to hacking scripts and other unwanted intrusions:

    sudo nano /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini

Now do a search for `expose_php` and change that setting to `Off`:

    expose_php = Off

### <a name="harden_apache"></a> Harden the ‘apache’ install.

Now let’s “harden” the `apache` install by adjusting the values of `ServerTokens`, `ServerSignature` and `TraceEnable`. You want to do harden the install to prevent exposing your server to hacking scripts and other unwanted intrusions. First, open up the main `apache` security configuration file:

    sudo nano /etc/apache2/conf.d/security
    
First, locate `ServerTokens` and set it to the “production” value:

    ServerTokens Prod

Now, locate `ServerSignature` and disable that as well if it isn’t disabled already:

    ServerSignature Off

Locate `TraceEnable` and disable that as well if it isn’t disabled already:

    TraceEnable Off

### <a name="apache_default_config"></a> Set the default ‘apache’ config.

Now, while `apache` already has a decent `default` config in place, I find it to be excessive and confusing for my purposes. First, open up the `apache` `default` config file like this:

    sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/default

And then replace the contents with the following basic `apache` config I like to use as a `default`:


    <VirtualHost *:80>
      DocumentRoot /var/www

      CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
      ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log

      # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit, alert, emerg.
      LogLevel warn

      Alias /phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpmyadmin/
      Alias /munin /var/cache/munin/www

      RedirectMatch 404 /(builds|configs|content)(/|$)

      # Including common items in a common file for ssl & non-ssl.
      # include /etc/apache2/sites-available/common.conf

      # Including common ModSecurity related items.
      # include /etc/apache2/sites-available/common_mod_security.conf

    </VirtualHost>

Note the commented out entries for including the contents of `common.conf` and `common_mod_security.conf` in the config. We’re not going to address those just yet, but those “common” files are there to make the job of including commonly used basic config and security settings easier.

### <a name="nicer_index_file"></a> Set a nicer default ‘php’-based index file.

And in a similar vein, `apache` installs a default “It works!” page in `index.html` that is fairly useless and problematic from a security standpoint. So let’s get rid of that file like this:

    sudo rm /var/www/index.html

And replace it with a new `php`-based `index.php` file:

    sudo nano /var/www/index.php

    <?php

    # phpinfo();
    # header('Location: http://www.preworn.com/');
    echo $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'];
    # echo '<br />';
    # echo $_SERVER['SERVER_ADDR'];

    ?>

If you look at the contents of the new `php` file, you see most of the items are commented out. That’s fine because this is basically the small set of commands I find useful to have at my disposal when setting up a server. The default command I like to set is the `echo $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'];` which returns the domain or IP address used to connect to the server. It’s very useful for setting up—and debugging—Apache virtual host setups.

### <a name="enable_apache_modules"></a> Enable ‘apache’ modules.

Now enable some basic `apache` modules if they are not enabled already:

    sudo a2enmod rewrite headers include proxy proxy_http

The list of modules is fairly simple to understand. The `rewrite` module allows you to setup Apache `mod_rewrite` rules. The `headers` module allows you to set and adjust headers. The `include` module allows you to load extra config settings via the `include` directive. The `proxy` and `proxy_http` allow you to set proxy settings on an Apache server.

### <a name="adjust_apache_group"></a> Adjust the ‘apache’ config to allow group ‘www-readwrite’ access.

As explained before, I like to set up servers to be collaborative environments based on a user’s access to the `www-readwrite` group. So with that in mind, let’s adjust `apache` itself so it interacts with the system via the `www-readwrite` group and creates files that have a `umask` value that allows for group reading and writing. First let’s open up the `envvars` file like so:

    sudo nano /etc/apache2/envvars

Append this to the end of the file to set the default `apache` `umask`:

    umask 002

With that done, change the `APACHE_RUN_GROUP` group in `envvars` to `www-readwrite`:

    # export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data
    export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-readwrite

Now restart `apache` so those settings can take effect:

    sudo service apache2 restart

### <a name="adjust_apache_logs"></a> Adjust ‘apache’ logs to allow group ‘www-readwrite’ access.

Since I like to set up servers to be collaborative environments, I also like to give them clear and easy access to the `apache` logs. It’s generally helpful for debugging. And here is how I do it.

First, change the parent permissions on the `apache` log directory so others can read and execute it for basic directory listings:

    sudo chmod o+rx /var/log/apache2

Now, change the group ownership of the contents of the `apache` log directory to the group `www-readwrite`:

    sudo chgrp www-readwrite /var/log/apache2/*

And change the file permissions of the contents of the `apache` log directory to `644`:

    sudo chmod 644 /var/log/apache2/*

Now edit the `log rotate` daemon script for `apache`:

    sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/apache2

The contents of the script should look something like this. You can probably just copy and paste this in place to replace what was installed by default. But the key item in this case is the line that reads `create 640 root www-readwrite`:

    /var/log/apache2/*.log {
            weekly
            missingok
            rotate 13
            compress
            delaycompress
            notifempty
            create 640 root www-readwrite
            sharedscripts
            postrotate
                    /etc/init.d/apache2 reload > /dev/null
            endscript
            prerotate
                    if [ -d /etc/logrotate.d/httpd-prerotate ]; then \
                        run-parts /etc/logrotate.d/httpd-prerotate; \
                    fi; \
            endscript
    }

### <a name="apc_for_php"></a> Install APC (Alternative PHP Cache) for ‘php’ to improve caching.

APC (Alternative PHP Cache) is a great—and very widely used—opcode cache module for PHP. APC does not do front-end content caching as much as it aids in caching PHP intermediate code behind the scenes to speed things up. There are two main ways one can install APC. The first way is to simply to install it via the Ubuntu package installer like so:

    sudo aptitude install php-apc

Seems simple enough, right? Well the problem with this approach is the repository version of APC is usually older than what is available in the real-world. In some cases, this is no big deal. The big test is simply: Does APC actually work well for your setup? Or is it bombing with tons of “segmentation faults” in Apache? If you run your setup with the repository version and things seem fine, then you are okay. But if it causes your website to fail with “segmentation faults” then your next best bet is to install it from source via `pecl`.

So let’s start by checking if the install of `pear` on the system ups updated like so:

    sudo pear upgrade pear

Next, install `php5-dev` and `libpcre3-dev` so we’re suer all dependencies are met when APC is compiled:

    sudo aptitude install php5-dev libpcre3-dev

Now run the `pecl` command to compile and install APC from source. Note the `-f` command which tells `pecl` to force the install of APC even if another version exists. The other version will be overwritten by the `-f` command:

    sudo pecl install -f apc

Now, edit the `apc.ini` file:

    sudo nano /etc/php5/conf.d/apc.ini

And make sure the extension is activated. If this line is in it, it’s enabled:

    extension=apc.so

Now restart `apache` and all should be good. If you want to disable it, you can open up that same `apc.ini` file and comment out the `extension` line like so:

    ; extension=apc.so

Restart `apache` again, and the extension is disabled.

Now—for most web servers—APC works fine out of the box with it’s defaults. But if you want to really fine-tune APC, open up that `apc.ini` file like so:

    sudo nano /etc/php5/conf.d/apc.ini

And edit values like this. This is a set of APC tweaks I have used on some servers. But again, these settings are not universal and should be tweaked if needed based on an individual server’s needs:

    apc.enabled = 1
    apc.shm_segments = 1
    apc.shm_size = 32M
    apc.ttl = 0
    apc.user_ttl = 180
    apc.gc_ttl = 180
    apc.num_files_hint = 1024
    apc.mmap_file_mask = /dev/zero
    apc.enable_cli = 0
    apc.max_file_size = 1M
    apc.num_files_hint = 512

### <a name="mysql"></a> Install the ‘mysql’ stuff.

Now that the `apache` and `php` stuff is set, let’s install the MySQL stuff. One simple and concise `aptitude install` command will suffice:

    sudo aptitude install mysql-server mysql-client

You might be prompted for a password for the root MySQL user. Choose whatever password you want for the MySQL root user, but make it unique. Avoid using a password that has been used before; such as the password you use to SSH into the server.

And one last thing: Whenever MySQL is installed or upgraded, it adds a few “test” items that I—and others—find utterly useless at best, security risks at worst. Such as a database named `test` and passwordless users—yes users without passwords— named `user`. The best and easiest way to get rid of this annoying cruft is to run `mysql_secure_installation`:

    sudo mysql_secure_installation

It will initially ask for your root password. Enter it and move on. The next question will ask you to reset the root password which makes no sense since you just entered it. So answer “no” to that question. Then answer “yes” to all other other questions such as, “Remove anonymous users?”, “Disallow root login remotely?” and “Remove test database and access to it?” Then the final question should be “Reload privilege tables now?” Answer “yes” to that one and your MySQL setup should be all solid and secure.
