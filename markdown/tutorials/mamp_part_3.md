# Developing With MAMP 2.1.4

## Part 3: Upgradng the PHP Pear Library in MAMP

Now we’ll install the whole PHP Pear library under MAMP. Yes, the whole PEAR library.

Why? Easy. While MAMP includes a few common items from the PEAR library, it does not inlcude everything. And since I am often dealing with developers—or projects—that make use of PEAR items that are not common to the base MAMP install, I might as well just install the whole PEAR library all at once in MAMP so I don’t have to worry about it.

So if none of that means anything to you, then don’t worry about any of this & stop reading now. Want to know more about how you can upgrade the PEAR librarin MAMP? Read on.
