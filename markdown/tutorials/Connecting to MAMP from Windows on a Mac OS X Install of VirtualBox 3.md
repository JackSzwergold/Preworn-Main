# Connecting to MAMP from Windows on a Mac OS X Install of VirtualBox

## Part 3: Advanced — Using a Dual Network Interface Setup with a Host-Only InterfaceSetting up VirtualBox with an additional host-only interface gives you the flexibility of connecting directly from the `host` machine to the `guest` machine. It also helps you eliminate the possibility of any inadvertent networking weirdness that might occur when managing the connections of a whole slew of virtual machines talking to the host machine.But if you don’t care about such things—or if networking issues give you a headache—turn away now. The basic setup tutorial should be enough for you.
### Let’s get started.
You will basically be setting up a static IP network within the **192.165.65.x** subnet on the host-only adapter. So your virtual machine will have a standard **10.0.2.x** address on the main network interface and another IP address within the **192.165.65.x** subnet on the secondary host-only virtual interface.The first step in setting up a host-only adapter happens in the main VirtualBox interface.

1. Go to the *VirtualBox* menu.
2. Then choose *Preferences*.
3. Within *Preferences*, select *Network*.
4. And then choose *Host-only Networks*.

There should be at least one item in the pane called *vboxnet0*. If you do not see anything in that list—let alone *vboxnet0*—don’t worry. Just click the small icon that looks like a small PCI network interface card with a green “+” plus symbol to add one.

You only need to add two items to create a new adapter:

1. The IPv4 address of **192.168.56.1**.
2. The IPv4 network mask of **255.255.255.0**.

And then click the DHCP pane and make sure the DHCP server is disabled since this will be a static network.
 Okay, got that? When all that is done your base VirtualBox `host` installation now has a new network interface that can be used for any/all of your virtual machines.

Now to set it up on a `guest` machine just highlight whatever VirtualBox virtual machine you would like to to have this adapter and: 

1. Click *Settings*.
2. Then choose *Network*.

At this point you should see an *Adapter 1* pane and that should be set to NAT. Don’t touch that, but now click the *Adapter 2* pane and:

1. Check the *Enable Network Adapter* box.
2. And then for the *Attached to:* pull down select *Host-only Adapter*.
3. And then under *Name* select *vboxnet0*.
4. Once that’s all set, just click *OK* and you’re done.

### Conclusion.

Now when you launch your virtual machine, you can connect to the gateway address of the host-only adapter, which is **192.168.56.1**. So if you were connecting to MAMP via this setup, the address would be:	http://192.168.56.1:8888And then when editing the `hosts` file the entries would be something like:	192.168.56.1	MY_MACHINE	192.168.56.1	MY_MACHINE.localThe other benefit of this setup is on your Windows machine you can setup a static IP address—like for example 192.168.56.10—and use that address to connect from your `host` setup to your `guest` setup.

Again, for basic Windows browser compatibility testing, that might not be a factor but it is a nice option to have. And having a separate network interface for host-only traffic can help eliminate the potential issues associated with having all traffic going through the main **10.0.2.2** interface.
